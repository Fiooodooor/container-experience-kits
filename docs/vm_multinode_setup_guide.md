# VM multinode setup guide

VM multinode setup means that we can configure more vm_host machines and spread VMs across all of them.
All requested vm_hosts have to be added to inventory.ini to section `all` with all relevat info and
to section `vm_host` hostname only.
To configure multinode setup for VM case we need to use two host_vars file templates.


## The first vm_host

The first template host_vars/host-for-vms-1.yml is used for the first vm_host inside vm_host group.
For the first vm_host we need to configure common parameters for the whole multinode deployment.

### VM image
The only common VM image for all VMs inside deployment is supported at the moment
Default VM image version is Ubuntu 20.04 - focal. That version is used when following params are not configured inside host_vars file.

Supported VM image distributions are ['ubuntu', 'rocky']. VM image distribution can be configured via following parameter:

```
vm_image_distribution: "rocky"
```

Supported VM image ubuntu versions ['20.04', '22.04']. Default is '20.04'.
VM image version for ubuntu can be changed via following parameter:

```
vm_image_version_ubuntu: "22.04"
```

Supported VM image rocky versions ['8.5', '9.0']. Default is '8.5'.
VM image version for rocky can be changed via following parameter:

```
vm_image_version_rocky: "9.0"
```


### DHCP configuration
dhcp for vxlan have to be enabled just on the first vm_host. "VXLAN tag" inside dhcp list means that DHCP will be configured for that VXLAN.
The same VXLAN tag have to be used inside `vms` definitions on all vm_hosts for all VMs. Param to be set there is vxlan: 128

```
dhcp:
  - 128
```

```
vms:
  - type: ...
    ...
    vxlan: 128
```

DHCP will use following IP range to assing IPs for all VMs. Unique IP range should be used for additional deployments on the same physical network.

```
vxlan_gw_ip: "40.8.0.1/24"
```


## Other vm_hosts execept the first one
The second template host_vars/host-for-vms-2.yml is used for all other vm_hosts inside vm_host group.

### DHCP configuration
Secondary vm_host - do not change dhcp settings here
dhcp list have to remain empty here

```
dhcp: []
```

The same VXLAN tag, which was configured for the first vm_host to be used inside `vms` definitions on all vm_hosts for all VMs.
Param to be set there is vxlan: 128

```
vms:
  - type: ...
    ...
    vxlan: 128
```


## Common configuration for all vm_hosts

### VXLAN device
vxlan_device parameter have to contain physical nerwork interface, which is connected to network.
All vm_hosts have to be connected to the same network and corresponding network interfaces have to contain IP address from the same subnet.

e.g.:
```
vxlan_device: ens786f0
```

### VM password
Set hashed password for root user inside VMs. Current value is just placeholder.
To create hashed password use e.g.: openssl passwd -6 -salt SaltSalt <your_password>
The placeholder have to be replaced with real hashed password value.

```
vm_hashed_passwd: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

### Reserved number of CPUs for host OS
cpu_host_os will change number of CPUs reserved for host OS. Default value is 16
It is for experts only who do performance benchmarking. Let it commneted out.

```
#cpu_host_os: 8
```
