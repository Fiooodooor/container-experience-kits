# MinIO Operator/Console/Tenant

## Cluster configuration options

In order to install MinIO Operator/Console set `minio_enabled` value to `true` in your group vars file. Setting it to `false` will disable Minio Operator/Console installation and cause other related options to be ignored.
```yaml
minio_enabled: true
```

In order to install MinIO Tenant sample set `minio_tenant_enabled` value to `true` in your group vars file. Setting it to `false` won't install Minio Tenant sample and cause other related options(host vars) to be ignored.
```yaml
minio_tenant_enabled: true
```

You can also change the MinIO Operator/Console namespace used for the MinIO Operator/Console deployment - by default it's `minio-operator`.
```yaml
minio_operator_namespace: minio-operator
```

You can also change the MinIO Tenant namespace used for the MinIO Tenant sample deployment - by default it's `minio-tenant`.
```yaml
minio_tenant_namespace: minio-tenant
```
### Access to MinIO Console

From your controller, get the JWT (Jason Web Token) to the MinIO Console Access
```bash
kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount console-sa --namespace minio-operator -o jsonpath="{.secrets[0].name}") --namespace minio-operator -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode
```

Now you will need to forward the port of MinIO Console service.
```bash
kubectl --namespace minio-operator port-forward svc/console 9090:9090
```

Depending on your environment, you can use tunnel to access your console. Here, I used the remote tunnel on x.x.x.x which I can open the MinIO Console UI
```bash
ssh -R 9090:localhost:9090 user_id@x.x.x.x
```

You can now open the browser on your laptop, and use the generated JWT to access Console UI at `localhost:9090`.


## Worker node specific options

There's also a set of configuration options that are applied in per-node manner.

First set of variables enable Persistent Volumes and also this info was used for sample tenant deployment. You would need your own tenant settings.
```yaml
minio_pv:
  - name: "mnt-data-1"                               # PV name will be followed by kube_node name(e.g., mnt-data-1-hostname)
    storageClassName: "local-storage"                # default storage class name which PVC should match with
    accessMode: "ReadWriteOnce"                      # ReadWriteOnce/ReadOnlyMany/ReadWriteMany/ReadWriteOncePod
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: "Retain"          # Retain/Recycle/Delete
    mountPath: /mnt/data1                            # mount path
    storage: file                                    # file = file block device, nvme = nvme m.2 SSDs.
    device: /dev/nvme0n1                             # when storage=nvme, device will be used for block device name. when storage=file, loop devices will be populated with /root/diskimage* automatically.
    capacity: 1GiB                                   # size of the PV. support only GiB/TiB
```

## Sample Tenants
In order to deploy the sample tenants, 4 or more worker nodes would be ideal for distributed mode. Current sample tenant deployment has two different modes. 

1. Test Mode (`minio_deploy_test_mode: true`)
In an automation environment, this mode is useful and deployed on a special block device called the loop device when no extra storage device, which maps a normal file onto a virtual block device. This allows for the file to be used as a **virtual file system** inside another file. 

2. Distributed Mode (`minio_deploy_test_mode: false`)
In clustering environment, this mode provides object storage service to build high performance infrastructure for machine learning, analytics and application data workloads. This mode uses local storage devices like hard disk, m.2 ssd, etc.

### Sample Tenant Secret Key
A MinIO user is an identity that includes at minimum credentials consiting of an Access Key and Secret Key. MinIO requires all incoming requests include credentials which match an existing user. You can find default credentials in 
```yaml
secrets:
  # create a kubernetes secret object with the accessKey and secretKey as defined here.
  enabled: true
  name: minio1-secret
  accessKey: minio
  secretKey: minio123
```
in ./role/minio_install/templates/minio_tenant_custom_values.yml.j2
 
Please refer to the [MinIO Operator](https://github.com/minio/operator) to get more details and usage examples.
