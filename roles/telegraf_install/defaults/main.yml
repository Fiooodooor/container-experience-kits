# WARNING: Current download script from PMU tools downloads events definition in old format.
#          The old format is used by current telegraf version correctly. In case of update
#          of telegraf OR PMU tools, changes may be required to achieve that intel_pmu plugin works.
#          Problem is following: format of event definitions json file has changed and now includes
#          'headers' section. Neither pinned versions of PMU tools nor telegraf is prepared to use
#          the section so its working correctly now.
#          Please read more here: https://github.com/intel/perfmon/issues/22

# PMU tools scripts to get performance event definitions of target system
