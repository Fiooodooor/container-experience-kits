# CNF Validation - Initially only test of SR-IOV count and mapping into CNF pod

## Summary

Script for testing environment to check how many SR-IOV VFs are used by deployed CNF pod and that those were mapped to the pod. These scripts were not designed and hardened to run in end user environment.

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes cluster with properly configured SR-IOV Device Plugin, configMap and CNI.

### For Docker-based version

Docker accessible for user.
From RA 24.01 release, default container management tool changed as podman based on default runtime change as containerd. User need to install docker based on BMRA access profile for stack validation. Reference steps to install and configure docker as below. 

Docker installation 
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker
```
Configure user group and restart service
```
groupadd docker  
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
```
Configure proxy for docker if needed.

### For Linux-based version

Study Dockerfile for details on required tools (jq, Robot framework...).

### Assumptions on CNF

Can be deployed with single command (which can be script that uses other commands).

## Configuration

Set environment variable KUBECONFIG to point to your Kubernetes configuration file that kubectl in Docker container will use.

Check config.json configuration options for validation.sh and test case details.

## Building Docker image

Use script build.sh or do similar.

```
./build.sh
```

## Usage

### Docker version

Use script run.sh or do similar.

```
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config  # or other location where kube config file is
./run.sh
```

Will start Docker container, then in it do:

```
./validate.sh [--debug]
```

--debug forces debug option even if config.json has "debug": false .

### Linux-based version

Instead of run.sh , do

```
cd image
```

then follow Usage like above.

### Example run

```
~ $ ./validate.sh
{
  "CNFValidation": [
    {
      "name": "podCheckSRIOV",
      "description": "SR-IOV pod count, node count and env var check",
      "pass": true,
      "debug": "sriovName=intel.com/intel_sriov_odu; podCountSRIOV=4; nodeName=name1, beforeCountSRIOV=0, afterCountSRIOV=4; containerName=sriovtest1, PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_INTEL_SRIOV_ODU=0000:4b:0a.0,0000:4b:0a.3; containerName=sriovtest2, PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_INTEL_SRIOV_ODU=0000:4b:0a.2,0000:4b:0a.1;"
    }
  ],
  "timeStamps": {
    "start": "Wed May 17 11:12:32 UTC 2023",
    "stop": "Wed May 17 11:12:48 UTC 2023"
  }
}
```

### Manually deleting namespace

If pod is left hanging after testing with k8s/1-sriov-test-pod.yaml:

```
kubectl delete -f k8s/0-ns.yaml
```

## Tested

Tested on:

* Kubernetes setup as per https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/flexran_vdu on Ubuntu 22.04 on server with Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Ethernet Controller XL710.
* Intel Network and Edge Container Bare Metal Reference System Architecture on Ubuntu 22.04RT with Access profile based on Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Ethernet Controller E810.

## Current limitations

It can check only for one SR-IOV device name.
